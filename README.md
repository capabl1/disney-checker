> function that extracts and returns THE authorization token from THE request's headers SINCE it is expiring every 1 hour ( or maybe + ), removing the "Bearer " prefix if present for a correct string, you can try first with getting it manually

```JS
const auth = (request) => {
  const authorizationHeader = request.headers['authorization'];
  const authorizationToken = authorizationHeader ? authorizationHeader.replace(/^Bearer /, '') : '';
  return authorizationToken;
};
```
